finn. A financial co-parent
for the overwhelmed

THE IDEA
Parents don't need a better dashboard.
They need someone to tap them on the shoulder
at exactly the right moment.

Finn · 9:14 AM
Hey — Emma turns 2 next month. If
you haven't started a 529 yet, now's
the right time. Takes about 8
minutes. Want me to walk you
through it?

yes please

Perfect. Utah's plan is best for your
situation — low fees, any state can
use it. I'll send you the link.
$50/month is plenty to start.

done. that was easy

You just gave Emma a $21,000 head
start. Nothing else to do. I'll check in
again in 3 months. ■

HOW IT WORKS
MONTH 1 Finn texts you. Reply with your child's
name, age, and a rough monthly budget.
That's the entire onboarding.
ONGOING Once a month — sometimes less — Finn
sends one message. One thing to know,
or one thing to do. Never a dashboard to
log into.

MILESTONES Finn knows Emma's birthday, when you
get a raise, when a sibling arrives.
Context makes the nudge land.
YEAR 18 Emma goes to college with a funded
account — because you got a text at the
right moment, every year.

01
Proactive, not reactive
Finn reaches out to you. No login
required. No habit to form. Parents are
too busy to remember — so Finn
remembers for them.

02
One thing at a time
No checklists. No dashboards. One
message, one action. The research is
clear: optionality is the enemy of
behavior change.

03
Calm, not urgent
Finn never creates anxiety. It
reassures first, acts second. 'You're on
track' is the most powerful message in
personal finance.

BUSINESS MODEL
$8/month subscription
Flat fee. No upsells. No referral distortion. Parents
trust Finn because the incentives are aligned.
Transparent affiliate revenue
Finn discloses referral fees openly. Trust is the
product.

WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT
Every other fintech product is built around a moment — the signup, the
dashboard, the app open. Finn is built around a cadence.
The longer you use Finn, the more it knows: your income, your kid's age, your risk tolerance, your blind
spots. The value compounds alongside the money. No competitor can replicate that relationship without
starting over — which means parents don't leave, and the moat deepens every year.
