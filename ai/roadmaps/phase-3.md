# Phase 3 — Message Library and Onboarding Test
*Duration: Weeks 3–4. Runs in parallel with legal review initiated in Phase 2.*

---

## Goal

Write and validate the five MVP message templates, then test the complete onboarding
flow with real humans who will give honest feedback.

---

## Entry Condition

Phase 2 complete: the signup → opt-in → Airtable flow works end-to-end in test mode.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Write the Five Message Templates

Each message must be written by the founder, not generated by AI. The messages
that come out of this phase become the training signal for AI generation in v2.
Writing them manually forces clarity about what Finn sounds like, what it is
allowed to say, and what parents actually respond to.

**Regulatory constraint on all five messages:**
- No specific 529 plan named as best for a specific person
- No personalized contribution amount framed as advice
- All external links go to savingforcollege.com or Morningstar 529 ratings
- Every message includes: "Reply STOP to cancel"
- Child's name must appear in every message
- Every message closes explicitly: either a clear action ask or explicit permission
  to do nothing ("Nothing to do this month. I'll check in next month.")

**Message 1 — Welcome**
Sent: immediately after YES reply confirms opt-in.
Purpose: set expectations, establish tone, give the parent an immediate out.
What it must do: tell them who Finn is, how often they'll hear from it, and that
they can stop anytime. Does not ask them to do anything. Does not mention 529 yet.
Tone reference from research: "Hi — I'm Finn, a financial co-parent for [Child's
Name]. I'll text you once a month with one thing to know or one thing to do.
That's it. Reply STOP anytime to cancel. First message coming in a few days. —Finn"

**Message 2 — First Nudge**
Sent: days 4–7 after welcome.
Purpose: this is the message being tested. The hypothesis lives or dies here.
What it must do: one thing to know or one thing to do. Not both. The child's name
and a timing anchor (their age or an upcoming milestone). A clear, single action
ask. An explicit close.
Two variants must be written, even if only one track is used in the initial beta:
- **Education variant** (for parents who selected $0 budget or are clearly unaware):
  includes one sentence explaining what a 529 is before the action ask
- **Action variant** (for parents who selected $25+ budget): skips the explanation,
  goes straight to the nudge

**Message 3 — Positive Reply Follow-Up**
Sent: when a parent responds positively to Message 2 (they want to learn more
or take action).
Purpose: give them the one next thing to do. Not a five-step plan. One link, one
action.
What it must do: acknowledge their reply warmly, provide the single next step
(a link to savingforcollege.com's plan comparison page), and tell them what to
expect next.

**Message 4 — No-Reply Follow-Up**
Sent: at day 30 if no reply to Message 2.
Purpose: lower-pressure second ask. Assume the first message arrived at a bad time,
not that the parent isn't interested.
What it must not do: guilt. Not "I noticed you haven't." Not "it's been a while."
Not urgency. Finn watches for parents, not over them.
What it must do: offer the same action, softer framing, explicit permission to
ignore it again.

**Message 5 — 30-Day Check-In**
Sent: 30 days after the action nudge (either Message 2 or Message 4, whichever
came last).
Purpose: collect the secondary hypothesis metric. Ask directly if they set up
the account.
What it must do: ask one yes/no question ("Did you get a chance to set up the
account?"), acknowledge either answer is fine, tell them what comes next.

**After writing:**
Send all five messages to legal counsel along with the consent flow from Phase 2
(they need the full picture to sign off on the TCPA consent analysis and the
investment adviser language review).

### 2. Write the Reply Handling Guide

Not a template library — a short guide for how the founder responds to the most
common reply types. The founder improvises from this guide, they do not copy-paste.
Copy-pasted replies feel like copy-pasted replies.

Cover:
- **"Yes / I want to know more"** → send Message 3 (positive follow-up)
- **"Done / I set it up"** → warm acknowledgment + tell them they'll hear from
  Finn again in a month. Log Account Opened = true in Airtable.
- **"Can't afford it right now"** → normalize completely. No pressure. Tell them
  Finn will check back in a few months. Log the reply in Airtable. Set a reminder
  to follow up in 90 days with a softer message.
- **"What is a 529?"** → one-paragraph plain-English explanation. Link to
  savingforcollege.com for more. Not a recommendation, just education.
- **"Who is this?"** → this is a failure signal, not a user problem. If this
  reply is common, the welcome message or onboarding flow needs work. Respond
  warmly, explain what Finn is, and offer to cancel if they'd like.
- **Complaints or hostility** → respond personally, not from a template. Offer
  cancellation. Log what they said.
- **Any question about a specific plan** → do not recommend. Refer to
  savingforcollege.com's comparison tool. Note the question for v2 product development.

### 3. Internal Onboarding Test

Using Stripe test mode (no real charges), run 5–10 people through the complete
flow:
- They visit the landing page
- They complete the Stripe test checkout
- They receive the TCPA opt-in SMS
- They reply YES
- They receive the welcome message (sent manually by the founder)
- They receive the first nudge (sent manually, days 4–7 later)

**Who to test with:**
Not friends who will be polite. People who will tell you when something is
confusing. Ideally: other founders, product designers, or parents who can give
specific feedback. Not the target user yet — this test is about the mechanics,
not the message resonance.

**What to look for:**
- Does the landing page clearly communicate what Finn is before they pay?
- Does the payment form feel trustworthy?
- Is the opt-in SMS clear about what they're consenting to?
- Does the welcome message set accurate expectations?
- Is there any moment in the flow where a real parent might stop and wonder
  what's happening?

Document every piece of feedback. Fix issues before proceeding. A confused
internal tester represents a churned real user.

### 4. External Message Validation

Before the beta, validate message copy with real parents outside your immediate
network. This is not a survey — it is a reading test.

**How to do it:**
Find 5–10 parents of young children in parenting communities (Reddit: r/Parenting,
r/NewParents, local Facebook parenting groups) or through personal introduction.
Not friends. Not colleagues. People who have no reason to be polite.

Show them Message 2 (the first nudge) as if it had arrived on their phone.
Ask:
1. What would you do if you received this text?
2. Would you reply? Why or why not?
3. Does the child's name in the message feel warm or does it feel off?
4. Is there anything confusing about it?

Do not explain the product before showing them the message. The message has to
work without context.

**What a passing result looks like:**
At least 3 of 5 say they would reply or feel positively about the message. No
more than 1 of 5 describes it as confusing or spam-like.

**What a failing result looks like:**
Multiple people say it feels invasive, they wouldn't know who sent it, or they
would immediately STOP. If this happens, rewrite the message and test again before
proceeding to the beta. Do not proceed with a message that fails external validation.

## What Done Looks Like

- Five messages written, reviewed for regulatory compliance, and sent to legal
  counsel
- Reply handling guide written
- Internal flow test completed with 5–10 people, all issues resolved
- External message validation completed with at least 5 real parents, Message 2
  passing validation
- Airtable still contains only test records — no real user data
- Stripe still in test mode — no real charges

## What to Check Before Moving to Phase 4

- [ ] All five messages written and in their final draft form
- [ ] All five messages sent to legal counsel
- [ ] Reply handling guide written
- [ ] Internal flow test completed — zero unresolved mechanical issues
- [ ] External validation of Message 2 completed — passed (3 of 5 would reply)
- [ ] No messages revised after being sent to legal without re-sending to counsel
- [ ] Stripe still in test mode

## Libraries and APIs Touched

| Service | What Happens in This Phase |
|---|---|
| Twilio Console | Manual test message sends to internal testers |
| Airtable | Test record creation and management |
| Stripe | Test mode checkout flow with internal testers |

The message library is a document, not a technical artifact. It lives as a
reference document for the founder's use in the Twilio console — a text file or
Notion page with the five templates, copy-ready with [Child Name] placeholders.
