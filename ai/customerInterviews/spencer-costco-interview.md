## Raw Transcript

My older brother went through IS right now or not right now. He graduated as a mizum. He's current currently he works for Salt. He works for startup right now. He is like probably the most entrepreneurship minded person I know. Go for it. And is currently like doing his own start up on the side. Nice. He also served in Peru and used WhatsApp so I feel like he could provide more insight. Go for it. Yeah. Got you. What domain is he in? Um, start up. Like, his? Both. Or, like, where he works? He works for deploy surveillance. It's like a company that does, um... I swear if he's sleeping. Hey, Spencer, I missed your call. There's no way. Took some. Um.. Oh, it says technical applicants. You must demo the functionality you built, non technical applicants pitch the startup. See I'm a non-technical applicant. Oh, they're other friends. Or am I attacking a clap? Yeah, but I want to be technical. I wanna do both. I'm a product builder. Um, So he works for deploy surveillance and they do, have you seen those things that like car dealerships or construction sites where it's like the security trailer and it like goes way up into there, has the cameras, the lights. That's what they do. Hey, what's up? How's it going? Good, how are you doing? Good. Good.? No, it's cool. Are you are you pretty busy right now? Are you at the bums? Yeah, we're hanging out with thumbs, but what's up? Um... This might be a little longer of a conversation. So if you, if a different time would be better then. That's cool. Okay. Um, we are actually in the middle of a game, so they pause from each side, feel bad. Yeah. Are you going to be there all night? How long are you gonna be there? We're probably leaving here around 11. Probably right at 11. Okay. We'll get home 11 for 10-ish, but I can talk too. Like, they can wait if it's important. What's up? Okay, yeah, so right now, um, I'm doing the sandbox sackathon. Oh, let's go. No way. Yeah, so... Yeah, it's kind of I've been convinced over the last couple weeks, so... I'm actually stoked for you, that's sweet, okay? Yeah, so, um, anyways, I'm I'm meeting with my group right now and we're brainstorming ideas. We thought we had something we'd pay everything like three or four. We talked about like 34 different ideas. Okay. Essentially, we're we're exploring this one idea, and I want like your honest feedback, like identify what the gaps are here. Okay. But one thing that we thought about was essentially a personal CRM so it would scrape all the information from your phone, from your messages, from social media. And would create an app that's essentially like a contacts app, but then it also allows you to prioritize the contacts and. Identify a cadence of which you would want to keep in touch with people just to help you to continue to keep in touch with those that you have a a close relationship with and also network with those that you want to keep a network with. The problem with this, um, the problems that we've run into are Apple has significant privacy, um, restrictions, specifically we wouldn't be able to pull any of that information of like what's actually talked about on the phone calls. And then also what any specific messages are. Yeah. Um, but one area we might be able to penetrate would be integrating this with WhatsApp. Yeah, what's that? What's that would probably work? I know WhatsApp is encrypted. Like, it's an encrypted chat. So I don't know what that would mean, but most chats, like, are not, most chats are not encrypted at risk, WhatsApp is. So, but you guys would probably know better if you looked at it, whether or not you can pull those. And also wonder if Apple, like, if you allowed Apple access to your stuff, if there was a way, like, if you consented, Yeah. Could there be a way around it? Maybe, like, of course, they have tons of privacy disease, but if you're telling Apple, This is what we're doing. Right. Maybe there's a way around that. I don't know. Someone in my, someone in my group is nodding their head. What do you got? Okay, so, so, um, there is a way. I told you, but you just have the name. And it doesn't cost anything, but WhatsApp, charges .035 cents. Or 0.035 dollars. So, 3 cents. Uh, every message that you, you get. Okay. And so we want to read their messages, which is the only reason we wouldn't be using apples, like integrating with Apple. If they were to send 10 messages per month with 100 active contacts, that's a 1000 messages. $35 just in those costs. Just to get that done. There's no way. So that's not even feasible. Dang it. But, yeah, that's crazy. But that bullet. Yeah, so I guess the Apple, the workaround, is they give you. You can get like the name and you can get that free so you would still be able to do like the check in cadence. Um, with those people. I guess one of the things behind the idea was it providing like a summary of your recent text with them like that sort of thing wouldn't be possible it seems like. Okay. So, I mean, I love the idea. I think it's awesome, especially if you put a lot of information in there, like, you got people's birthdays that you want to reach out for, and I think it's awesome. I think it's a great tool for like keeping people connected, but yeah, the feasibility is hard. You could also look at social media for that potentially. A lot of people are chatting back and forth on those. I don't, I have no idea what that would look like getting access, but I'm assuming you could, you could do, like, a, on your app, you could log into Instagram the same way, like, did Angel, you log into Netflix, you know, give it access that way. I'm not sure there, but... Right. You could look social media for that. You know? Um... Oh, seriously, nothing was gonna say about this. As a mouse, but I lost it. Do you have any burning, burning startup ideas? Actually, I do have one. Um, I have been thinking about this so much. So if you want it, you can take it. Um, I want us to the biggest issues that I'm seeing at my company and at other companies that I think they're struggling with. is how to use AI securely because either you have no policy and people are thrilling all of your company data into different tools, or you have a strict AI policy, and no one's really using AI to anything useful, so you can't see company data in there. A workaround is a locally hosted model. So if you like, if you can do this on your computer today, you can download a model from hugging face, running locally. And it's completely private because it only lives on your machine. But I don't know if this is a sandbox. It's not technically app. But if you guys can figure out a packaged way on each cloud service, to set up a local model that would easily integrate with a company's stack. There are companies that I think would pay good money for, like, a turnkey solution on that. So, for example, if someone's on AWS, and they are trying to figure out AI, they want us to need a ton of company data, sensitive, sort of data, financial, legal, whatever. And you set up a downloaded model on an, like an EC2 instance or whatever AWS is setup is for that. It could be literally whatever they want into there because they own the bottle. They have to worry about privacy or security or anything. And if you can come today and then and say, hey, we have this entire setup, turn, can you ready to go? We'll implement it your business, you can use it day one. And you have a completely private model to feed all your financials into and get insights. Could be cool. Yeah. Don't know if that's where I want to go, but that's an idea of that. Maybe there's someone doing it. I have no idea. I don't look to drink too much. Yeah, no, that's a great idea. Sweet. Well, I'll, sorry, go ahead. Now you're good. I just kind of see, are there any other ideas that you wanted to run by? Run by me? Do you guys have anything? Just the financial one. Yeah, yeah, go pitch, pitch that one real quick. Super fast. The other idea was, like, right now, a bunch of credit card data comes in as like, oh, $300 at Walmart, and it's not broken up by, like, item. Yeah. And so getting that itemized data would be good for both consumers that want to budget, like, by line item, and the other one would be for, like, turning in receipts. You wouldn't have to turn in receipts anymore to your company. Yeah. So the idea would be, if I go to Walmart, do I have to scan my receipt afterwards? Is that how that would work? Uh, no, so that's the workaround. It would, you would either like digitally get the receipt in your email and it would automatically pull it from your email, or we work directly with Walmart to just make an API, um, to, to, to feed it to either the business or... To like to Walmart? Okay. Yeah. So your options would be, you work with the credit card company, or you work with, like, Walmart, Costco, whatever. Yeah, work with the point of sale system. Yeah. That would be awesome. If you guys could figure out how to make that work, I think that's a really, really... I mean, there are some there are some hurdles to making that work. Yeah, I do. Like, you gotta get access to whatever their API looks like. You're like, kind of have to have them in there. But, like, I would pay for that. What's that be awesome? Why would you pay for it? Well, we, this is actually, you hit on a personal paint. My, our budgeting, like, we have a baby, and we go to Costco and Walmart, and we have these big old, we just put it all into groceries. I have no idea what we're actually spending our money on. Like, I do guess. But I don't know what goes into diapers and baby clothes versus milk and eggs. And I really like to know. So I can, right now, there's a lot of solutions that'll let you scan your receipt, but that's, you know, that's pretty annoying. Only the people that are really diligent are gonna do that, so... Yeah. If you could solve that problem, where I literally just go swipe my card, and then it's easy right to my budgeting app. I would pay for that. That'd be pretty sweet. Sweet. Dope. Thank you. I like it. It's a tough hurdle, but if you could figure it out, that'd be incredible. So, hey, so... Thanks, Good luck. Let me know if you have any others. Yeah, thanks, Spence. That was extremely helpful. Yeah, you got it. Good luck. All right. Love you. Love you. Bye. Bye.

## Key Takeaways

- **Who:** Married with a baby, IS alum, works at a startup (Deploy Surveillance), has his own side startup — entrepreneurship-minded
- **Personal CRM idea feedback:** Loved the concept of a relationship cadence/reminder tool; flagged Apple privacy restrictions and WhatsApp API costs (~$0.035/message) as major feasibility hurdles
- **Bonus idea Spencer pitched:** Turnkey locally-hosted AI model for companies wanting to use AI securely with sensitive data (AWS EC2, etc.) — companies would pay for a pre-packaged setup
- **Itemized receipt pain point (the big one):**
  - Goes to Costco and Walmart with his family — everything gets lumped into "groceries"
  - Has no visibility into diapers vs. baby clothes vs. food
  - Current solutions require manually scanning receipts — too much friction, only diligent people do it
  - **Would pay** for a frictionless solution: swipe card → auto-itemize → syncs to budgeting app
- **On feasibility:** Acknowledged the API access hurdle (need partnership with Walmart, Costco, or credit card companies / POS systems) but said "if you could figure it out, that'd be incredible"
- **Willingness to pay:** Explicitly said "I would pay for that"
