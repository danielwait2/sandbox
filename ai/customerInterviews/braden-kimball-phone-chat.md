You
Did you get 

Braedon Kimball
And 

You
that notification? 

Braedon Kimball
you were. I, it told me this call will be 

You
Ah, 

Braedon Kimball
recorded. 

You
that's funny. Um, sorry, I just turned that on. Thought that might be a little bit helpful, but, um... 

Braedon Kimball
Well, 

You
No, 

Braedon Kimball
has it been recorded? 

You
I'm late to the game. I should have started from the beginning, but um... 

Braedon Kimball
That's okay. 

You
Yeah. That was kind of. I guess is there any other thoughts that come to mind? 

Braedon Kimball
Um... Let's see. Um... Uh, let's see. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I think the receipt. I I think one thing I'm thinking of is like. Ah, it's tough because it's like, how much do you want the person to do? But maybe if you have a feature, or something where it's like, You, I'm, I'm just trying to think of a way where you don't have to, in a very easy way at your email. So it's like maybe if you can like, have an auto forward option or instructions of like, hey, if you have concern about us getting your email, here's how you can set up emails you get from Walmart and wherever you shop to something or set up a label or something. I'm just trying to think of ways that you could maybe. Because I can guarantee you there are people that won't do it if they know that you're going to access their email. 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
Um, So I don't know. I mean, that's just a thought, but, 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
I 

You
Have it 

Braedon Kimball
mean, in the short 

You
have 

Braedon Kimball
term, 

You
it redirect somewhere else. 

Braedon Kimball
Yeah. Yeah, so essentially you would then, you would either send it, you send it somewhere. You send it like forward an email to an email address that you have. Or... I don't know. Yeah, just some way to like. Or. Have. Hmm. 

You
11 thing that we thought of, and this might get you thinking a little bit is. A B to B model of this would be actually partnering with the grocery stores and using their API. to 

Braedon Kimball
Right. Yeah. 

You
do this, but I don't know if they would want to do this. I mean, the barriers of to entry 

Braedon Kimball
Right. 

You
there would be pretty massive. 

Braedon Kimball
Right, you need permission. You need this. My, my thought was similarly like being able to give the, you know, say, hey, if you have concerns about us getting into your personal email, sign up for your receipts to go here. 

You
Mm. 

Braedon Kimball
The hard part about that is, is like, hey, put this email address in that will manage. And then we'll send you the emails we get because they're still going to want out the emails. The hard part about that is the communication aspect of that would seem pretty complicated maybe. And that's kind of like you're doing a lot of extra stuff. I'm just trying to think of maybe like some type of option of like, you get the email instead of the customer, but typically Walmart is going to want you to sign up to get receipts and promotions. So I'm just trying to think of a way for you to get the receipt in an easier way than having to scrape or go through their email. Because maybe the scraping's not that big of a deal. Maybe it's like, ah, we, you know, the way that Gmail's set up, we feel pretty confident in just being able to look through it. It's more so the consumer of like, how do I, it's a guarantee. So that's kind of what I'm trying to think of. So that would just be my only thought is if is there some way to access the receipt in a way that doesn't seem so invasive, which to me, I personally wouldn't be all that concerned about it. 

You
Yeah. 

Braedon Kimball
So, um, Let's see. But yeah, I think I think for me, the biggest thing that I would want to see from the app is trends and suggestions of like, hey, you're spending, you know. This much more on this item than you have been or this is a new trend or something like that or milk's getting more expensive. Here's alternative options or. 

You
Yeah. 

Braedon Kimball
I don't know. Because you, the tough part about this is you could make it so big, but the scope needs to be specific enough. So. Yeah. But I like it. I like it. 

You
Sweet. 

Braedon Kimball
But yeah, I I don't know that I would anytime soon, and especially I would say you wouldn't right now, but I don't know if anytime soon I would, the B to B stuff seems way too much. 

You
Yeah. 

Braedon Kimball
Like that's like negotiation and your massive corporations. I don't think are going to entertain that for a 2nd. 

You
Yeah, we, 

Braedon Kimball
Personally. 

You
yeah, we're not gonna touch that, at least right now, like maybe if, maybe if we actually get accepted in the sandbox, it would be something we'd look into more, but yeah. 

Braedon Kimball
Right, I think you certainly consider it, and you just even, you know, at that point, it's, you know, have a conversation with somebody at Walmart and say, hey, has, has anybody considered this if we did it, how can we make it beneficial for you? Because they're going to need something out of it. So. But yeah, I don't know. I like, I think it's a cool idea for sure. So, That would be my my number one concern would be security, but my number one, you know, reason I like it is the lack of manual labor on my end. It makes it so much easier. And if I don't have to track anything, Makes it really nice. So. 

You
Yeah. 

Braedon Kimball
So, I mean, if you tell me, if you tell me tomorrow, I have an app that's working, that'll scan your email, pull receipts out, show line items, and show trends without getting up all in your business, I'm all in. There's like 0 hesitation. for me. So, And maybe there's some, some, you know, Like, there's a lot of companies that I'm now thinking of that have access to my mail. It's like, hey, sign in through Gmail or access through email and it's like, maybe there's just a lot more behind the scenes that Google has allowed. security wise, it's like, hey, you know. 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
As long as you do this, yeah, we, you know, you'll be 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
fine. So, 

You
There's like AI connectors, 

Braedon Kimball
obvious. 

You
like I can connect. Claude at work to my Gmail account. 

Braedon Kimball
Right. Right. Yeah, so I just don't really und know that world and what the capabilities are. And so maybe my concerns are not a concern at all. You know what 

You
Yeah. 

Braedon Kimball
I mean? It's like, ah, we just, Here's how we can filter through. And when you, you know, when it's Walmart, we'll open up Walmart, go in there, we'll ignore any credit card, any information on that front, any personal information, we'll just look at the line items. Like maybe that's super easy. Maybe it's not. So. 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
So yeah, that's that would be the number ones on both sides is, promise me security and I'll use it like that's, it seems like a no-brainer idea. So. 

You
Yeah. Sweet. 

Braedon Kimball
And I think for me, the suggestions. I don't know that I would pay so much for that as I would like, hey, here's some suggestions of like, hey, don't buy exit, Smith, buy it at Costco or whatever. Like that, that's one where it's like, oh, like I didn't even have to look of like, oh, okay, I know I'm spending more on eggs or there's cheaper eggs options out there or my, you 

You
So 

Braedon Kimball
know. 

You
that. 

Braedon Kimball
It's like, 

You
So 

Braedon Kimball
if it tells me, it's like, yeah. 

You
that would be the big incentive, incentive for you. 

Braedon Kimball
I would pay more if it tells me exactly how I can save. Because then I'm guaranteed savings and 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
it's like, that's why I'm using the app. That's why I'm paying for it. Whereas it's kind of like, I might use it for a few months and it's really nice to see trends and be like, hey, you're spending more here and it's like, okay. 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
This is really good information. Thanks, you know, I'll use that on a free tier, maybe a dollar a month kind of a deal. But when it's like, hey, this is what you're doing, this is how you can make it better, or we recognize you're buying a lot of spaghetti sauce. Like, why don't you look at, instead of buying spaghetti sauce, here's a recipe, you know, this is maybe a little bit more out of scope, but it's like, your spaghetti sauce is costing a lot. Maybe look at alternative options for a spaghetti sauce. Like, here's a cheaper spaghetti sauce or, you know, have some type of AI integration of, like, how can I make it cheaper, really good spaghetti sauce? You know, there's like a whole bunch of things that you can do, right? But it's like, for me, the value comes in, not having to do anything and then saying, okay, I'm spending more here. Here's how you can hear our suggestions. Like that's the 3 things that I need from the app to pay more than a couple bucks a month. 

You
Right. 

Braedon Kimball
So, that would be my, my, the value it would bring for me. So. 

You
Sweet. Yeah, 

Braedon Kimball
Yep, hopefully that's helpful. 

You
no, that's extremely helpful. Thank you. I 

Braedon Kimball
Yeah, yep. Of course. 

You
appreciate it. 

Braedon Kimball
And 

You
Thanks 

Braedon Kimball
if 

You
for taking some 

Braedon Kimball
when 

You
time. 

Braedon Kimball
you, when you go big, I'll manage the data warehouse. 

You
Okay, sounds good to me. All 

Braedon Kimball
Alright. 

You
right. Thanks. 

Braedon Kimball
Okay, good luck. 

You

You

Braedon Kimball
Bye.
