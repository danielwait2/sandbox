## Raw Transcript

Do you guys budget? Do you guys have a budget? Do you budget at all? Yeah. How do you budget? I actually do paper or not. Is it Y now? Is it monos? Uh, copilot. Co-pilot. I saw some of those. I love it. paid 95 a year for it. Yeah. Why does it do? What's your biggest pain point? And it's what our app's addressing. What's the biggest pain point of copilot? This is good. gosh. I mean, you log into the app? And you're like, ah. Like, I'm excited. I even know. Yeah, I would say, like, their goals suck. Like, they, I don't know, goals feature, but it's not very good. So, like, I would love to be able to, like, view my savings goals better than the way they show them. But, like, I really do like this app guys. Like, I would not pay that much if I didn't. Have you ever tried wine app? So what is it called? Why not? YNAB? No, oh, I have heard of that. What do you love about it? What does it do that you want? I can see how much I'm budging for this month and like a graph showing like where I am like over under, like on track. I can categorize all my transactions. How do you do that? How do you do that? I can show you. Do you have to do it manually, though? No, they have an AI that will do it for you, and you can also create rules to do it for you. So, hope you guys don't care about this kind of finances. Oh, I. If you don't care, we don't. Yeah. So, like, we budget 4000 this month and we're over. But that's okay. It's all right. So the end of the month. Do you have any transaction? You're almost there. Yeah, so you have like all your transactions here. And like the label, they label them all, and you also have like, um... But you can't see recurring ones. Can't see what? You can't see like the specific items that you get. No, you can't unless, um, and they have an integration for Amazon that does that now. But you can't do it with, like, like normal shopping. How do you do the Amazon integration? Like, does it automatically come in or do you just press it by the right here, you, like, like, add to it? I guess we haven't done it yet, but you can do it. Cool. This isn't, this isn't, how are they not getting sued by Microsoft right now? This isn't Microsoft is it? No, oh. Um, I did, so this is, this is not co-pilot, co-pilot? No, this isn't. Oh, sorry, I thought you guys knew. This is its own app. It is not Microsoft. Yeah, no, I know. I'm saying. Yeah. So they have the same name, but I think these guys might have existed even before, like... Like, I think that's all I guess. They probably are technically Microsoft co-pilot, and then it's probably COVID. Oh, yeah. That's probably it. Does it ever bother you whenever you get a transaction for Walmart so you don't know if it's under like household or groceries or food? I feel like the only that's the same thing. We just consider Walmart groceries and so I put it in my groceries. But what if you buy like oil? Oil? Like, for your car. Like, you'd be like, car oil? Sorry. Sorry, Carl. I kind of, I kind of do just accept the fact that, like, it is that, it's not gonna be perfect, and it's also groceries. Like, that's kind of just how I am. Okay. I feel like the only pain point that we're solving for is that it's like differentiated groceries. That's what we're that's what we're all for. I care more about like, I'm if I'm like under, over for the month, mostly. You know, rather than like, are all my transactions categorized correctly? I guess. Even though, like, that does matter, too. Do you feel? It doesn't have to be like 100% accurate for me. Do you feel like with your grocery shopping specifically, you're like a little bit blinded to how you're spending money when you go to the grocery store and you feel like you wish you could spend better in that area or not really like you're able to handle it pretty well because of this. Um, It's interesting to think, like, Budgeting does help, but, like, it's not the end all beyond that really, like, shapes all your decisions. Like, I feel like I'm hearing apps more and more that's like teaching people how to spend better or like build better habits while spending or like with their finances rather than just budgeting. So alliance, I have them based off the church as well. Yeah, I've seen no, I've seen that. Like, those things are like coming out right now. Yeah, I'm sure there's tons of them right now. Would you, um, would you be interested? So you wouldn't really be interested in splitting up the Walmart or Amazon or whatever, like getting a line item? Be able to... No, I personally, I don't feel like I would need that. Maybe it's just because I'm so used to it too, just how it is. It doesn't bother me. Because my budget app has it, like, it's per category for a month. Uh-huh. So, like, you have to figure out where which category goes where. And it's like, oh, it's a Sam's Club, but if we go to eat, what if we buy it? Yeah. Interesting. Good feedback. What about you? Sorry, I wasn't with that one. I sorry. I didn't hear that. Do you budget? budget? Do I budget? No, right now. Okay, no. I don't use the software. Anything holding you back from it? Living at home. I can get the name. I'm not budgeting for rent right now, so... I don't know. Actually, here's my pain point. I can't forecast in, um, copilot. See, you can in wine app. Really? Yeah, it's all forward looking. That's the big thing. It never looks back. All right. Yeah, that's the thing I wish I could do. I literally have an Excel sheet just for like projecting. Really? Yeah, that's true. Oh, it's awesome. That's what I use. I don't have an app that does it. Why NAV? It's called YNAP stands for you need a budget. It's a free 1st year for students. You are their biggest advocate. They shouldn't sponsor you. Yeah, you should. I've heard you talking about it. I'm like, five times. Today. I'm separate. Five separate occasions. I think like every, I would say like every 4th conversation with Daniel. The main problem with that app is what I what I realized tonight is stupid. It comes in as a transaction of whatever. Yeah, that one. Oh, that's funny. So yeah, it's it's free for the first 30 days and then you can sign up with your students free for a year. But you connect all your accounts so all the transactions come in automatically, then it tries to organize them and you approve all of them. But you can change the category. Clay, as much things. it's growing. Yeah, it looks forward. So you butt you basically it's a bunch of envelopes and you put money into, so you put money into this. You assign all your money and then you sign it for next month and you sign it for next month. And then you can see if you're on track for goals. True, and stay out of it. What if we can scrape all that? That's kind of cool. We get all that information. It's $109 a year. Oh my gosh, you go in Europe? Yes.

## Key Takeaways

- **App used:** Copilot budgeting app (not Microsoft) — pays $95/year, genuinely loves it
- **Pain point #1:** Goals feature is weak — wants better savings goal visualization
- **Pain point #2:** Cannot forecast forward — uses a separate Excel sheet for projections; YNAB solves this
- **On itemized receipts:** Does NOT feel a strong need for line-item breakdown at superstores (Walmart, etc.) — has accepted the imprecision and just buckets everything as "groceries"
- **What matters most to them:** Knowing if they're over/under budget for the month overall, not per-item accuracy
- **Insight:** Interested in apps that teach better spending habits, not just track spending
- **Willingness to pay:** Already paying $95/year for Copilot; open to better alternatives
