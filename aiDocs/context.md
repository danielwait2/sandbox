# Project Context

## What This Project Is
Finn is a text-first, AI-native fintech app that helps parents save for
their children through proactive SMS nudges rather than dashboards or apps.
Parents onboard by replying to a text. Once a month Finn sends one message —
one thing to know or one thing to do. The value compounds over an 18-year
engagement window. Tagline: "A financial co-parent for the overwhelmed."

## Current Phase
Planning

## Core Product Principles
- Proactive not reactive: Finn reaches out, user never has to log in
- One thing at a time: no checklists, no dashboards, one message one action
- Calm not urgent: reassures first, acts second
- Text-first: SMS is the entire interface for the user

## Target User
- New US parents (3.6M new per year)
- Parents who are overwhelmed and too busy to manage finances actively
- Parents whose children have no 529 plan yet (82% of US children)

## Business Model
- $8/month subscription, flat fee, no upsells
- Transparent affiliate revenue (disclosed referral fees)
- Employer benefits channel: HR pays $3-5/employee/month as parental benefit

## Key Differentiator
Finn is built around a cadence, not a moment. The longer someone uses it,
the more context Finn accumulates (income, child age, risk tolerance,
milestones). That relationship cannot be replicated by a competitor without
starting over — creating an 18-year moat.

## Decisions Made
- SMS/text-first interface, no app or dashboard required for end user
- Flat subscription model to keep incentives aligned with user trust
- Proactive outreach cadence, not reactive engagement

## Known Constraints
- Must feel calm and reassuring, never anxiety-inducing
- Onboarding must be reply-to-a-text only, no forms or signups
- Messages must be infrequent — once a month or less
- MVP should validate the core SMS loop before building anything else
