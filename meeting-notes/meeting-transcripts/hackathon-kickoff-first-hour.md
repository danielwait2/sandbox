Okay, so we have 3 categories of app ideas. Budgeting app, recipe app, and not eating out. Budging app, it's hard to be an Excel sheet.  It requires someone with discipline. Uh, most people don't use budgeting. Recipe app, there is recipes on Googles, websites already exist for it.  Uh, Not eating out. Uh, what's the point with that one? I feel, like, why I don't think it would work.  My feeling is like the... I'm only basing this on me, so it's very biased. I don't eat out because I don't want to spend the money.  When I do eat out, it's 'cause I don't have the time. And so, like... Like, I I don't have the time to...  Like, I can just order something and get it fast. So like, time is the issue. At least for me, I'm a very biased standpoint.  While I was writing the South, what if we... This isn't, like, rejecting you. I'm just trying to understand where our app is going.  This is still brainstorming. don't have an idea. I haven't even built a prototype, so it's very much this idea. anything out. We could even pivot completely.  Um, Okay. What if we? What?  I, I, I have an idea to pivot too, but I know you don't want to do it. Is it healthcare? Yes.  Okay. Okay, so which one are you most passionate? What problem?  Because let's not think about it from a solution. Let's think about it from promise. What problem are you most excited about?  Maybe maybe let's write out both of our problems that we have in budgeting areas, in recipe areas, and then eating out. I like it. So let's start with the budgeting.  For me, I forget about my budget. Like, yes, I can remember that we have $50 to spend more for the rest of the month on one item, but I don't remember all of it. Mm hmm.  And... I feel like alignment with spouse, I don't really have this problem, but... like, the... the top three is... the top three, one of the top three causes of divorce is... finances. But...  As you as you have used a budget, what are some things? Um, a lot of it is, like, if you connect it with your, uh, your bank account, it's like manually putting in the transactions, figuring out where they go, if it's a Costco run, you know, what goes to household, what goes to groceries. Same with like Walmart or the superstores.  Um, Yeah, like reviewing it frequently, trying to make it proactive instead of reactive. A lot of my friends have said, when I talk to them this weekend, we're like, I just hate having to go in and like, it's too much work for the benefit I want. It's just, it saves me time and stress by just not even having a budget.  Which is crazy. I know. So...  When I think about this, I think of that one app that links to your credit cards. Like, why not? I think so.  Is it like $30 a month or something like that? Yeah, it's like 120 a year. Okay.  I just heard it and I was like, that's too expensive for me. That what we use. Oh, okay.  So, but but that doesn't that doesn't sort it, right? So it does, it does its best at sorting. But it doesn't get, like, going on your line items, because it can't?  No. No, they can't. So, like, your Amazon, all it knows is you spend $50 on Amazon.  It has no idea what it is, so it just uses like, usually when you order from Amazon, it goes in this category. So you manually sort it as it comes in. It gives you annoying or for you, is it just like...  Well, I mean, yeah, you have to go over to Amazon and see what it is and figure out, do the mental load of where it goes. It's $120 a month. A year.  A year? Sorry. 120 a month. That'd be crazy.  Okay. So it's 10 bucks a month. Oh, that's actually not too bad.  And it pays... I looked into, like, the APIs and connecting your accounts. It's like ¢30 to a dollar per account, you connect.  So it's also something they can... Their margin is like 950. Per account.  If you have multiple accounts, you connect. That's crazy. Different bank account.  That's crazy. So is there a way? why don't you ask AI, is there a way to find, like, a line item on a receipt?  I don't think there is. But could you, like, access an API? Well, you couldn't get their data because of privacy concerns.  Sorry, I'll just explain what I just went through. No, I, no, I, I know what you're saying. Yeah, Amazon or like if you could have them log into Amazon or log into Walmart in the app and then be able to hit the API and go back.  Yeah. Yeah. Um, So that's an idea.  I don't know if Yeah, anyways. Okay, so... Yeah, yeah, let me.  Hey, let me ask real quick. So, there would be a massive market in being able to hit an API that goes to square or goes to, you know, whatever POS system that a store uses and be able to come back with the line item. So we don't even, we don't even create the, we don't create.  This is like B to B you're talking about. This would be B to B. This would be like, This would be like automatic. Um, This would be, what's it called, where I use the company card, swipe it for a dinner?  What's that called? Reimbursement? Yeah.  Ooh, that's so good. Daniel. See, this is, I'm open to, I'm open to talking.  You talk your head, talk what you're thinking. That's not that idea. I think that idea is a really good idea, because... eliminates fraud.  I just want that. Okay. Hold on, let me write this out.  So your service, it finds out what exactly my credit card bought. I see a line item for Walmart and can I call Walmart to get the receipt? Oh, could I go get a some pizza?  Yeah, go for it. Be right back. Yeah, can you grab me some?  Okay. Sorry, I'm just. Go for it, go for it.  Is it not there? No. Okay.  Okay, so this is what I've gotten. Is there a service that finds exactly my credit card bought? Read it.  So not really. Well, from what I can tell, I'm gonna go ahead and ask Jim and I real quick. if it can... If it can, uh, find out.  I this would be cool. I love a good Fintech. I do too.  All right, while it's doing it, what do you, uh, let's go through this. Do you wanna keep talking about this idea? Or do you want to keep, um, writing out?  Yeah, yeah, let's keep going down this and... Okay. So, for recipes?  For me, um. My wife hates eating the same thing. Well, she's been so...  She'll spend, like, an hour trying to find a recipe. It's crazy. When does your wife get home?  Usually? Uh, well, she works evenings. I know.  Uh, like 930. 930? Yeah.  What, you ask? When did she go in the morning? I just remember you saying that she works mornings and nights or evenings.  She goes at 9:00 in the morning. Good? So usually you're here.  Yeah, I never see her. It's kind of sad. What about, does she work Fridays?  I mean, Saturdays, Sundays? No. Um.  Like linking it with current food. I don't know, I'm not really a fan of a recipe. I'm not gonna lie.  I don't want a recipe app because I either A, like, like, recipes come into use to, like, there's 1000000 excuse me, there's 1000000s of recipes. That's not the problem. The thing is, I've got some food in my fridge, what recipes can I, or what can I make from it?  So the recipe's like finding, you know, what food you can make from it. Boring. You can already do that on like chat and Google.  The other is like, Olivia will look up recipes in the beginning of the week. Probably what your wife does and say, okay, what food do we need to go get for the recipes? And so it's like, you know, preemptively, that's kind of the idea that I was going down.  Still like, okay, then you have to save these recipes. Or maybe it just gives you a general idea. Which, I'm positive, there's 700 apps that do that.  Yeah. Dude, this research seems cool. Okay.  Um I don't know what other, like, pain point a recipe app is solving. Maybe it's like calories, like, I want a low calorie or like, uh, uh, food, um, like food allergy to some sort of, like, health conscious. Someone changing their habits because of something.  I do not want to get in that space. No. I'm sure...  I'm sure, like, Weight Watchers has the, the, a recipe you will use. Yeah, weight watchers in the 8000 other apps that are adjacent. Yeah, a bit non-big apps.  Okay. Um. Eating out thyme, energy, speed.  I guess it goes with time, good. You're just not a good cook. Okay.  Like, skill? Um, social. Okay.  I, the reason I got into eating out is because it was an easy thing to tackle for budgeting. Because the other ideas were like, you know, like decrease your internet. Well, that's interesting.  Yeah. To me. What if we keep talking about this and talk about pain points that companies might have with like reimbursement issues?  Unless you want Fraud? Yeah, that's that's what, I mean, immediately came to mind. It's fraud, time, accounting.  What do you mean in counting? Just like... into their system? Like the accounting of where the money goes kind of thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So we could output data for them to be like, Okay, this goes into this spreadsheeter system or whatever.  Yeah. Like, is this, I don't know exactly how companies do their accounting with corporate cards, but like, is this a software expense? Is this a party expense?  Dinner traveled. Um, do we want to think of more pain points? Well, Like approvals?  I don't think that's really a big issue, but... Oops. Yeah, that's yeah, good idea.  It's close. It's analyzing the results. This is cool to even see the thinking.  It's like. Oh, does cloud code not be that? Perplexity is that?  Well, kind of? Perplexity just kind of says it's like searching this. I don't know, maybe.  Oh, these are the steps. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this insight, insight. You know, yeah.  Um Conrad just said the pizza will be here very soon. Just got off with the phone with the vendor. Okay.  I guess. I think it's gonna be... Papa, do you know what, is that the green box?  Uh, yeah. Because then his Domino's is blue. Domino's, Pizza Hut, bread, Pop John's green, Little Caesars.  It's funny, they said the vendor. Yeah. The restaurant.  Okay. Um.. Do you want to keep thinking of, like, ping points in different areas?  Um... Yeah, let me think. Which area?  The, the one that we've identified on the right, I saw come up a time in the research I was doing. If you, or if, if I even search like, So there's already things out there with it. Yeah, I'm just gonna see if problems sorting or transactions and failed manual transactions.  Exist. Yeah, I threw a bunch of... things in here. These are perplexities, and then this is Gemini, just one big...  Love it. All right. Okay, so miscategorization.  So this is the transaction pain points. Miscategorization, bank seat connection failures, duplicate missing transactions. So this is the main one that we... attack.  Yeah. So, would we... would we say... With, like, Walmart, it links to your card.  So... it would be hard if... Like, if it's not their corporate card, it'd be hard to track that, 'cause if someone's just, like, submitting, oh, but then they submit a receipt and they're like, here it's what I got. But a corporate card's a little bit different. right?  Oh, you're right. They totally just send a receipt. And that's why there were a ton of companies that said, Yeah, we just scan and itemize receipts.  Yeah. Because they want a receipt. Um...  Where are we at W320? Could you look up the door? Um...  325. Okay, let's not tell McKay when he comes in, and let's just run through and see what his ideas are. And then, uh, see if he can come with any new ones.  So don't pigeonhole them. Okay. Yeah, that's a great idea.  Should we, like, take a picture of this and erase it? No, I think I'm fine. I don't think he'll read enough.  Is there any... Is there any other areas that you'd be interested in? Um...  User floor. Dang, now I see how much fun it is to, like... Yeah, I can build up a quick API, maybe.  Actually, the whole thing's an API, so no, but like, I want to go see if businesses want to pay for this now. Like, this is my instinct is I want to go and call up. a business and be like, all right. What, this is the, this is a problem.  Do you experience it? How big is it a problem, you know? Yeah.  Oh, it came back with it. So, um, what was your question? Um, the question was...  Uh, we should the current... Well, you can read it. And this is the answer?  Mm hmm. Here, I can, um, if you want. I'll just throw this into... here and then you can ask questions and stuff.  Love my, uh, kid's been pushed. Okay. So you can just say, like, Hey, look at this file.  Tell me a pink, or you can read it. Okay. Sounds good.  Yes. I like your... Oh, push?  Your, uh, comment. It's very good. Well, it said, like, a suggestion.  It was, like, create this file as, like, the push description, and I said yes. thinking it's an LLM, but that's funny. Then I was like, oh, whatever. So... my thought process is small companies, just have you submit a receipt.  Big companies will have a card. At least that's what I think. Well, whenever I submitted reimbursements, it's always a receipt.  But do you have a corporate card, or do you just get reimbursed yourself personally? Um, because, because my company, well, my LLC, like the bank I'm with, this is, this is literally like the, You can judge me how much money I have in this bank account. It's okay.  I know you don't keep a lot in it. Well, and it just don't make a lot. Is, um...  You literally have multiple cards, and these are virtual cards just for one thing. And I can like order a card physical. Oh, really?  So I'm sure they have a lot of, yeah, like create a, like a physical card. Huh. So maybe, I mean, like, after the hackathon.  Uh, We could figure out some... Yo, metal car? Stuff, if we were...  Metal cards are so cool. Do you have medical card? No.  But, like, when I was a cashier, and someone would hand me, like, a AMEX carp is, like, a pound. I'm like, dang. Dang, boy.  Sorry, what were you saying? Um... Oh, yeah, receipts for small business is big, have the card.  But, I guess, maybe ask, do you want to ask Gemini that? Like, do companies typically use receipts or cards more? Um...  If you don't want to, I can't too. How do... Oh, I'm sure they do both.  If you use a company card, you swipe it, and you have to turn in the receipt. Is that what you're saying? Oh, but our our, but our app would say, like, you don't have to return in the receipt.  Correct. We just automatically. I'm just wondering, like, how many how many companies have a card?  And how many just have the receipt, and then they reimburse back to the personal? Oh, the personal? Uh, it's just both.  Oh, yeah. The employee pays for business expense with their own card because then they get the miles. Or they get the points.  Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying. But employees who regularly entertain clients...  Ooh. But that's, like, that's, like, bay firm. The IRS requires receipts to prove the purchases were actually for business.  Oh. So, that's still okay, because they're requiring a trail. But if we got a digital receipt, we'll just call this a digital receipt. to make it easy.  We got the digital receipt directly from the company. They have the credit card on file. Wait, this would literally just be solved with the credit card being on file by the payment processor, swipes.  They get a receipt. you want a printer email? No. And it automatically emails it to the corporate.  Yeah. But then the corporate has to go look at that receipt. And I didn't make sure it's okay.  Yeah. Hmm. Hmm.  Hmm. Companies will usually issue smart corporate cars on an app when an employee swipes the card for a coffee, the app immediately pings their phone asking for a photo of the receipt. The employee snaps a picture.  The AI reads the receipt. Matches it to the card transaction and automatically categorizes it. eliminating the need for manual expense reports at the end of the month. That's cool Mm hmm.  Mm-hmm. The way we could get this over with manually is, so it said somewhere that like, oh, over here? No, over here.  Pizza is on its web, sir. Don't worry, I'm gonna go. 810, Yeah, go, go.  You can go get... Oh well. Yeah, grab me some, please.  I don't know like. Yeah, like as well I Thank you. Grab, uh, like one or two?  Here, I'll take the one, you take the two. I got four. I can go get more if you want.  No, you're good. I already have dinner, but I can grab you more. No, you're good.  Um. So. There's so much I've already learned.  There's level one data, which is like, your purchase amount, the, the, doing business as, the zip code. There's a level 2 with slightly more information, level 3 is like all the items, the detailed description, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah.  I saw that in, or I guess I might have just rented off yours. My brother in law? Uh, he's an accountant. and he's like, Yeah, we usually, like, the miscellaneous expenses are just us eating out.  And so he's like, we'll blow, like, $4000 on a meal. I just charged the client. And I'm like, what?  That's crazy. That is nuts. Yeah.  He, 12. Bruh, this is this someone else? Someone do this?  Awkward. I just brought more pizza. Did you guys just go up there?  Did I miss you? Mm, did you see me? I went there, like, Five minutes ago.  Yeah, like five minutes ago. How'd it go? Good, we won.  Oh, wow. Nice. Don't look close.  Yeah, we're too closely at it. We're asking... No, we're asking you questions before you look into your opinion.  Okay, sweet. What's up? Are we in white if you guys are eating?  Yeah, yeah, eat, take your time. Let me just finish. I'm ready to go.  You're hyped off off a win? Dude, I am actually amped right now. All right.  So. We thought of, like, the 3 areas we were trying to attack. And we were thinking of pain points. in those areas that we had.  Before we ask you for your pain points, do you have another area that you'd like to move on? Like, area as in just anything... Oh, like anything, like scratch what we're already thinking about.  Kind of, yeah. Kind of. Only if you want.  If you like what we're doing, then we can continue on in this direction. I like it. Okay.  What? So when you make a budget, what are your main main points? Do you have a budget?  Mm hmm. Um, pulling information from lots of different sources. I'm looking at my credit card statement.  I'm looking at my bank account, and I'm looking at an Excel sheet. That's true. Especially if you have investments, it's...  Right, a lot. Yeah. So I'm looking at a 1000000 different places.  Wait, do you include your investments in your budget? You do like your net net worth or something? Uh, I just invest, like, every...  Oh, you put it into investments or you look at your line items in your investment account? No, just like part of my budget is... Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then a lot of my, like, our checking account is on Fidelity, but I also have a bank account. Oh, you're a CMA guy? Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I want to see a May guy. Sorry. Are you a C main person?  CMA. Check checking management. Cash management.  Cash management, yeah. No, let me take this. You guys can still chat.  Oh, wait, no, I can't chat, 'cause this is recording. Sorry, David. Okay.  Uh, what else? Um... I mean, the other part of it is just knowing what's, like, what's smart, like, what's the right decisions to make?  As far when it comes to budgeting, like how much should I be saving? How much is feasible to be saving, especially right now when it's like, okay, got about school with school payments and all those things. So it's like, okay, what?  Yeah. What do you usually use to find that information? Um, or do you just kind of guess?  It's kind of just gas, honestly. Anything else? I would say I use, like, my family a lot for advice, so, like, someone that doesn't have family that they trust to ask about these things, like, that would be a pain point of having, like, outside feedback from people I trust.  Do you ever go to like AI to find that? I haven't, but I probably should. All right.  I don't. But just asking. Okay, now.  Um, Cooking, food, recipes, did affordable. Why are you affordable? Because...  What did you make for dinner tonight? This? This?  This is what I ate today. Today? I woke up, had cereal.  Oh, oh, I see. okay. For lunch, work brings in food every Friday. So it's Chick-fil-A today.  Which you got to pre-select your meal earlier this week? Yeah. And then I went to my parents' house in Lehigh because I work in, like, we're in office something, and got 3 slices of banana bread.  And then I came here and not eating pizza. I feel like for food, I'm horrible because I feel like I don't have any time to cook, and I don't have, like, the expertise to, like, cook things, huh? Maybe, but there's probably just because I'm lazy.  When it comes to this. So how do you solve that? Do you solve that by not eating?  by eating them? Not eating, eating the same things or relying on my resources. By resources, I mean, like, my parents.  Like, things like this, where I'm getting free pizza, that's cool. I totally did that when I was seeing that. Yeah.  Or the bed? It's like, and the meals I eat, when I do, like, make things for myself, it's always, for breakfast, it's always like oatmeal and toast. For lunch.  It's either ramen or um, fried eggs and toast. For dinner, it's spaghetti or ramen or um, breakfast burritos. And sometimes quesadillas.  Sorry, I'm just laughing because I did the same thing. It's just it's just what you gotta do. I'm so very.  Oh, sorry. I was gonna say, I also like... I feel like having a significant other would motivate me to, like, want to make nice food.  Oh, it does. For my significant other, so like if I was there's no doubt in my mind, like, I would be whipping up some crazy recipes, cause I just would love my wife. So I'm sure you guys could.  But currently I don't have a wife. Like, like stuffed peppers that I made tonight? All right.  What about eating out? Do you eat out a lot? I mean, do you pay?  How often do you pay eating out? I mean, a decent amount. At our dates or anything?  Depending on the week, like, once or twice a week, probably. That's probably not true. It's probably more, like, two or three.  Two, three. Between, like, friends wanting to go like get something. Or just having no time and not having eaten anything that entire day.  Or yeah. You know, one time, my friend comes to me and he's like, I have a business idea for you. And he's like, what if I made a dating app that instead of like swiping up and down on people, you swipe up and down on dates, like, let's go to Lagoon.  Let's play pickleball. That's crazy. Wait, wait, it just on, like, like, you already have a date, now it's what do we do?  No. You know, like, You both spotted up on Pickleball. even though they took a ball. That is definitely addressing the like the symptom and not the problem.  Okay anyways. Do you like eating out 2 to 3 times a week? Not really.  I don't like spending money. You're a fruit guy? I try to be.  This is our target user, right? Except when it comes except when it comes to golf and all that's rough. But yeah, I hate spending money.  I actually despise it. Is it the time, you said it was time and expertise? Hmm.  I just... Blew me in. I missing something here.  I just feel like we can't give them more time. I don't see a solution where we can make an app. If there was a meal that you could do in 15 minutes at home, would you make it?  Like, how much time, because how much time is it to go to the store? Is this like you're driving home from work and you're like, okay, I'll stop real quick? You know, like, what is the, what is time?  Yeah, like if I knew something, like, hey, you can make this in 14 minutes, it's gonna give you all the nutrients you need. relatively cheap. Like, yeah. I actually saw.  This is kind of related to what we're doing. But I thought it was actually... I just feel like it's already there.  It is. It probably is. But it's not the problem isn't that, though.  The problem is that the lack of knowing that there's a recipe. So check this out. He doesn't.  He doesn't, it's because there's no food at your house, right? So this is, I think, really interesting. Tovala, you actually, you know what?  lets not go to the checkout. Lets play the video. It's gonna explain a way that I can.  Watch this. Do you need more pizza? I can go grab more pizza.  Well, I guess you should probably... I should watch the video. Yeah you should watch this.  And after. How it works. while you're gone, I'll explain to McKay what our ideas. We're recording this by night, so we don't have to take notes. awesome.  Oh, my wife just cried for... 50 minutes because she watched the Neil Diamond movie. That's awesome. All right, well, she explored it, doctor. notes.  It's the annoying question you... What's for dinner? It's the annoying question you face every day.  So you might wear something sad and not for the best. Or settle the takeout. Again.  But it shows up cold. Messy, and never quite what he wanted. But what if he already had the answer?  Me?. Just grab a fresh chef crafted meal, take one minute of easy prep, scan the QR code, you start, and walk away. That's it.  Dinner's done. While it cooks, you get time back to do the things you want. Get outside, catch up on your shows.  So do you have the Tavallas? We don't go too far. Is there another company that does this?  I've seen one where it's like If you can focus less... Up on each other. And we'll want to enjoy fresh.  Kevin's are on top. Two perfection. Just a delicious home cooked meal without any other work.  With Tabola, dinner's done. How much is it? So, with this referral link...  You choose your milk plan. 16, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4 per week. And they, right now with this, you get an oven? We basically get an oven free with this referral link. which is actually pretty sick.  But then, for example, the 8 meals a week plan is 103.92. It's about 1299. Okay.  A meal. But it's, they send it to you, send it to you at the same time every week. So, like, On Monday or whatever.  Thursday? Thursday, Tuesdays, or Thursdays. It ships to you.  They send you a oven before they send you any of the mills, and then you just have the oven. It's yours. And then you literally scan the QR code and it presets the oven to whatever it needs to be, pressed start while it's in there and then the... about sick.  And I think this is one that's actually gonna stick around. But I don't know. I think there was there was another one.  Let me look at Tovala's competitors. Do you want more pizza, guys? I'm okay, I'm for now.  I might go get a new thing. But they're probably, yeah. I mean, total...  Shoot, sous vide. Do you ever go to the doctor, okay? Um, I used to.  When I was a kid. Yeah. Over on the mission.  My dad doesn't go to the doctor's. I don't do. He is a doctor.  Tobala, a smart oven and no delivery service, surpassed $110 million in revenue by early 2022. Driven by 100% year over year growth during that period following the ship from aggressive expansion to profitability. 2024 revenue estimates for the company and varied with some sources listing it around 42.5 million. Factor meals.  Oh, my mom has gotten those once or twice. They're not good. Yeah, I mean, like, anything that comes in.  Anyway, so what is your idea? Let's go grab some pizza. Are you gonna get it?  I don't need any. you want me to grab some for you? Oh, well, if you don't need anything, just go grab them. Go get some pizza.  Okay. Don't worry. We'll talk trash about you.  I know. Basically, we gotta hit the core problem. So this is my, this is, this is what I propose at the very beginning, was...  Um, it's 4 o'clock. You're hungry. You don't know what you're gonna eat for dinner.  And you still have an assignment to do. You know, you're, like, working on it, and so then you're, like, okay, there's nothing at home. Let me go out to eat or whatever.  The, The solution is like, yeah, Uber eats something or you go and grab something. Or you go to the store, get ingredients, and then make it a home. And so the that's when you realized you had the problem, was at 4 o'clock?  But we could solve that prematurely by like, you know, sending you notification, here are your meals you need to plan for the week. Add to the order, check out. And it delivers at your house.  You have the food already at home. And you already know that, like, you can make all these meals in 15 minutes. That's what the, my original pitch was and we're exploring like, why that doesn't work.  There's a couple holes I've realized in that why that would work, why that wouldn't work. I forgot my plate. So.  Yeah, he's assuming. Did you run up the stairs? Dang, not even breathing hard.  Do you like barbecue pizza? No. Oh, do you?  Oh, I do just... Well, anyone wants one. That's right here.  Um... Yeah. I was just explaining the original idea.  And then we came to understand the core problem, like the core problems we're trying to solve. The budgeting app, the recipe app and nighting out, attacking all of those. That's what we were going to.  All right, take us away. Take. Oh, you didn't tell him about our idea?  No, I was just saying the original pitch. Oh okay. And then, like, this is the core ideas that we were thinking.  Yeah, so these were like why it's not going to work. What our pain points were. And then we talked about sorting and how Daniel's app, that he uses for budgeting, will, like, kind of sort based on where he bought it, but it doesn't know what he thought.  So if he goes to Costco and buys oil for his car and rotisserie chicken, it's gonna put it all in dinner, or food, or whatever your thing is. Right. Um, so we were like, what if you could go in and get the itemized receipt?  And then Daniel was like, what if we did it for businesses who are reimbursing people or who use, like, their company car? Because then that helps reduce fraud, it saves them time because they don't have to go and look at the receipt and scan it in. Um, that can lead to, like, better, um, sorting of details, and then just, like, knowing where everything's going, it would help with the purpose.  That was our idea. We did a little bit of research. Our main problem is, like, a lot of companies, you have to report the receipt anyways, so they just scan it. there's a lot of apps that just scan the receipt and, um, like, put it in.  But we were thinking, well, what if you don't need a receipt? If it's a digital receipt, and, like, we could just get the information from the stores. It would only work with, if you use a business card, though, because you'd have to log into that account with that business card.  And because of privacy data or privacy issues, you'd have to log in with that account, and then you could get, like, the stuff they bought. But if they bought it with their own card, you wouldn't be able to log into their account and see what they bought because of data privacy. Does that make sense?  You can't lie into someone's credit card account. Like, if I go for my work and buy, I don't want my company logging into my credit card. Is that what you were saying?  No. Just, it would be really cool if you had something. That's connected to your credit card account, to your bank account, to everything.  And literally analyzes your spending with your income and everything else. And then provides recommendations based on, I don't know, this is... Yeah, it needs to itemize data.  Is that what you're saying? It needs, like, to itemize what you bought at the place. Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, I guess that's true because it just shows the total. Yeah, Walmart for 150 bucks is like, did you buy a switch? So that's what you're saying, get it from the stores.  Yeah, that's our issue. So yeah, how would this look? Well, the initial people who don't want us to do this is Walmart, Kroger, big stores, because they like the data themselves.  Right. And so if we have access to everyone's itemized receipts, Is there a way to have someone often? So, a lot of receipts nowadays are digital.  They're sent through email, they're texting to you, whatever. Is there a way that we could have someone often, where any digital receipt that goes to their email or is texted to them? automatically gets redirected to our app, and then we log that data.  That's a great idea, and that's what I just drew out. Stick. Guys, I'm going with something.  So, I, so we sell to the company. The company makes an account where they can, like, you can buy stuff with their corporate card. It'll come back, it'll itemize it, whatever.  But an employee can also be attached to the company, and when they go to Walmart, they can buy something, and then in this app, that the employees in will, it'll say, like, is this a personal or a professional, like a personal expense, or work expense? It's a personal, just forget about it. And if it's a professional expense, it'll go back to like the company's system where it can do all its itemizing stuff.  So, this was allowed, this would be B to B, this is in BC. Yes. This would allow the employee to sign into their Walmart account, and we could then access the data through that, I think.  And then the company, of course, with just, like, their corporate power. What do you guys? My friend said he'd pay 20 bucks a month if YNAB did that, like the budgeting app did itemized.  I would pay for it. And I don't pay for anything. That's the worst part about why I am.  Do you know why that is? So, questioning at mint mobile or, I mean, mint. What if we go back to to a budgeting app?  and just... do this at a lower cost, because their... their cost per user is crazy. This would be great for Acton, because we can just budge all the data. The hard part's getting it from Walmart.  We can just say we got it for the half time. And like, there's a big CSB of all the transactions and then we manually... It's worth them.  You know, it's the whole, you know? I mean? I think we just need to decide whether this is, you know, be for companies or personal or maybe we have like a bulk thing going on.  Where's the lid on this? Because I mean, there's there's all these things out there. I was going to ask, who are the companies that are like, like rocket, no?  Rocket, rocket money? Just checks your subscription. subscriptions. Yes, you ask for all the time.  And I bet you they're getting bank, and you're getting a lot of money from that service, because everybody wants to know what they're spending on subscriptions, because there's 5000000 subscriptions out there. Obviously, that's kind of, like, entering their operating a lot of other services, but, like, I absolutely would pay... to know exactly how I'm spending my money without having to manually log it. So, like, BWE is cool.  I think B to C is massive, but it's like the problem of how is that possible? I understand the problem B to C. Theoretically, I understand the problem from B to B, but, like, I experienced the B to C.  That's how I felt. I'm a user. Obviously, B to B is always going to make you more money.  Well, what if we just start out with B to C? and then when our sandbox company takes off, we go B to B. There we go. I, like, you know, this is apparently hot.  Like, businesses currently have to have something, right? Where they're, what are they? We lift it up.  What do they currently use to see all their expenses? Well, from their credit cards. Is that what you're saying?  Right. Like, everything else is gonna be itemized. How does it work?  How is it itemized for credit cards? Three ways. One is I use my Discover card, you know, my personal card.  I have a receipt, and I send in the receipt using the mobile app. Their mobile apps, to send in their seat. The receipt gets itemized, you know, like gets read, and itemally, or is tech currently doing that?  Like, in AI, reads it, and IOS is it. Um, 2 is the same thing, but I use a corporate card. I still have to turn in the receipt, either physically or I take a picture of it.  Right. Uh, C is, uh... I take a picture and I say what it was.  I mean, wait, no, I use a credit card and I say what it was. I don't actually have a receipt. It's like failing.  And the pain point for businesses, what's the whole reason that businesses do this? This is for compliance. Like accounting and stuff?  I also think for fraud. Yeah, fraud. And you can't fake an API.  Right. Uh, let's see. Okay.  Mm, mm, mm. Oh, it's, uh, it helps maximize iris, tax deductions. Guys, this is the problem.  I get super excited about an idea. And then I find out all the problems after thinking about it every 2nd of the day. A couple days later. later, and then I switched to a new idea.  But I'm glad I could bounce it off you guys. Like, we can all chat about it. Dude, why is your Codex so small?  I don't know. It's growing. It's young.  I guess I could make it bigger. I love the, uh, just the preview of the dock. It's just a straight wall of things.  Oh, yeah. How do you do, like, how do you view it as like a markdown again? I forgot.  It's button. The second one. This one.  And then, uh, exit at the other. Except that's no markdown, but like you go to it. But that does look better.  Yeah. All right. Wait, how do I accept this? All right, what do you guys think? The BSE angle, at least for Hackathon? Is that what we're thinking?  Or we're thinking the B to B for Hackerbot? Um, Well, besides, I forget the name. Way now, way now.  Why now? YNAB? You need a budget.  YNAB? You need a budget. Cool.  Besides that, are there any other, there is monarch money? But none of these sort, based on your actual Monarch money, I just looked it up, has an ability to, as a receipt, you take a picture of the receipt, and then it waits for a transaction to come in through your credit card and then it matches them. Okay.  Wait, what's your full question? Oh, does rocket money explicitly do subscriptions? Like, they don't have other services?  They do have, I think they have other services. They have other services. I also...  That's our main thing, it looks like. Yeah, I think that like it's like, hey, I'll save you $40 a month on your internet. For a year, you pay me $60 to cancel the subscription, and then like, You save $180.  You save 2 40, but then you pay 60. Yeah, or whatever the math is. Jesus.  Okay, I'm gonna stop this recording and put it in, uh...
