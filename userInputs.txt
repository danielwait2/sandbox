Task/Stage: Phase 1 - Success Criteria Validation (Google OAuth end-to-end)
What is needed from user: Provide valid Google OAuth credentials in runway/.env.local (GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET) and ensure redirect URI http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google is configured in Google Cloud.
Why blocked: Cannot complete live Google sign-in flow or verify /api/auth/session includes user.email without valid OAuth client credentials.
Exact next command/file change to resume: Update unway/.env.local with valid Google credentials, then run cd runway; npm run dev and complete sign-in at http://localhost:3000/signin.

Task/Stage: Phase 2 - Success Criteria Validation (live Gmail scanning)
What is needed from user: Valid Google OAuth app credentials in runway/.env.local and a signed-in Google account containing Walmart/Costco receipt emails.
Why blocked: Live endpoint validation for /api/receipts/scan requires authenticated Gmail API access to real mailbox data.
Exact next command/file change to resume: Update unway/.env.local, run cd runway; npm run dev, sign in at /signin, then POST to /api/receipts/scan.
