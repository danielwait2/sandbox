SB06 Hackathon: Overview & Requirements
The Sandbox Hackathon is an intensive 24-hour sprint. Whether you are launching a new idea or accelerating an existing project, your goal is to work with your team to move the needle on a real startup.
Logistics
Timeline: Friday, 2/27/26 at 7:00 PM to Saturday, 2/28/26 at 7:00 PM (Local Time).
Submission Deadline: All materials must be uploaded to the application portal before Saturday at 7:00 PM.
Closing Celebration: Ask your local director for details.
Where can you build: Ask your local director for details.
Teams: You must arrive with a team already formed and registered in the portal.
Prompt
Build something that moves the needle on a real startup. Most likely this will be a prototype that you could show to your first potential customers that demonstrates the value of your company. But if you’ve already started a company, it might be a new feature.
One Rule
Your submission must represent new progress. While you may build upon previous work, we are only evaluating what you accomplished during these 24 hours.

Success Strategies
Build a real company: Do not treat this as a one-off competition. We reward teams building a startup they intend to pursue long-term within Sandbox.
Build a functional prototype: Build something a customer can actually use. At least part of the prototype must be coded to demonstrate technical capability, but don't be afraid to use manual processes ("Wizard of Oz" style) for non-essential features.
Think deeply about your pitch: Go beyond the obvious. We look for deep insights and clear communication.
Don’t over-engineer: Your time is scarce. Only code what is essential; handle the rest manually.
Don’t do surveys: We value first-hand customer observation and interviews over high level survey data.
Be honest: If something failed, tell us what you learned. Failure can be a great source of earned insight.

Submission Requirements
Each team member must individually submit the following four items to the portal:
1. Hackathon Progress Video (2 Minutes Max)
A video documenting your 24-hour progress.
Technical Applicants: You must demo the functionality you built.
Non-Technical Applicants: Pitch the startup, covering:
Problem/Customer: Who has the pain and how deep is it?
Solution: How does your product solve it?
Market: What is the specific market opportunity? (Avoid generic market stats).
Competition: What is your specific unfair advantage?
Why Now? (Optional): Why is this the right moment for this idea?
2. Pledge Video (60 Seconds Max)
Success in Sandbox takes an enormous amount of focus and effort. Tell us how much you’re willing to commit to succeeding in Sandbox:
How many hours per week will you spend building your startup during Sandbox? (hint: if it’s not at least 25 hours, you won’t get in).
What other distractions will you have during Sandbox? How many non-Sandbox classes will you be taking? How many hours per week will you be working at a part-time job? (hint: we’re going to look at your outside commitments and decide whether we think you can realistically put enough time into Sandbox).
Detail the sacrifices you are willing to make to ensure success.
3. Team Formation Summary (Text)
Finding the right team is the first big test of a founder. While your hackathon teammates may not be the teammates you’ll end up building a company with, how seriously you took this process gives us an indication of how seriously you’ll take it in Sandbox.
How did you find your hackathon teammates? How much time did you spend together before the hackathon? What did you do together? How committed are you to this specific group?
4. Preparation Statement (Text)
We’re looking for candidates who are taking Sandbox very seriously. Describe the specific steps you have taken to prepare yourself for the challenges you’ll face in Sandbox.
Video Guidelines
Platform: Upload to YouTube (as "Public" or "Unlisted").
Format: Standard video only. Do NOT use YouTube Shorts.
Validation: Test your links in an incognito browser before submitting.
Time Limits: Strict limits apply (60s for Pledge, 2m for Hackathon). Over-length videos may be penalized.
Pro Tip: 
Items 2, 3, and 4 need to be completed within the 24-hour sprint. Pick a specific time to complete and upload these during the hackathon so you can focus primarily on building.
