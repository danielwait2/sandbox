# Tayt — Product Interest Survey

**Goal:** Understand target audience pain points, behaviors, and willingness to pay for a product that turns food spending into a weekly cook-at-home plan and prefilled grocery cart.

**Length:** ~6 minutes

> **Survey platform note:** Route anyone who answers "Never" to Q1 to a thank-you/disqualify page. All other respondents continue.

## Section 2: Concept Test

*Before we ask about your current habits, we want to show you a quick product concept.*

**Q8. Here is a description of an app we are building:**

> You connect your card or upload a recent bank statement. The app finds your restaurant and delivery spending, then suggests meals you could have made instead — with a prefilled grocery cart ready to order. Each week you get a plan based on what you actually spend, not a generic meal kit.

**How valuable does this sound to you?**
- Not valuable
- Slightly valuable
- Moderately valuable
- Very valuable
- Extremely valuable

**Q9. Which part of that description sounds most useful to you? (Pick one)**
- Seeing what I actually spend on food
- Getting meal suggestions that match my spending habits
- Having a grocery cart already built for me
- Tracking how much I save over time

**Q10. What is your first reaction to this product? What excites you or makes you skeptical?**

- Yes, but I stopped — it wasn't worth it
- No, but I'd consider paying for the right product
- No — I would not pay for an app like this

**Q20. If you were going to pay for an app in this category, what would make it worth it to you? (Pick your top 2)**
- It works automatically without me having to think about it
- It gives me a specific action to take, not just a report
- It shows me real, verified dollars saved
- It saves me time, not just money
- It builds my grocery cart so I just have to hit order

## Analysis Notes

- **Primary qualification:** Q1 = 2+ weekly orders. Disqualify "Never" before Section 2.
- **Attention check:** Filter out any respondent who does not select "2–3 times per week" for Q11 before analyzing results.
- **Segmentation:** Cross-tab Q3 (household size), Q4 (dietary restrictions), and Q5 (grocery behavior / meal kit use) against Q8–Q9. These determine whether the core product loop is viable for each segment.
- **Concept interest signal:** Q8 = very/extremely valuable AND Q9 single-answer distribution.
- **Unprimed reactions:** Q10 is the highest-signal question in the survey — read every response before analyzing quantitative data.
- **Behavioral pricing:** Q21 removes the savings anchor deliberately. Expect lower numbers than a primed version — that is the point. These are more honest floors.
- **Data-sharing risk:** Q17 is the single cleanest read on this. Watch for "would not connect under any circumstances" — that segment cannot use the core product.
- **Barriers vs. disqualifiers:** Q16 "already have a system" is not a blocker; "I still prefer convenience" is a soft blocker; "would not connect financial data" (Q17) is a hard blocker.
- **Qualitative gold:** Q10, Q18, Q22, Q23 — required and optional open-text fields. Read these before drawing any conclusions from quantitative responses.
